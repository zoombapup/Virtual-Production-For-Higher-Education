### Project Description
This project is to gain experience with virtual production techniques and hardware for the creation of new VP-enabled content for the higher education sector. Specifically, the production of VP content using Unreal Engine for a third year computer science graphics module as a prototype and research opportunity to learn what form education content that incorporates virtual production techniques might look like.

### Is it a good use of Unreal Engine?
We can see that online video based teaching is going to be very much in demand and technologies and tools that enable it will be a required skill set for the foreseeable future. This project recognizes that change and wants to learn how real time graphics and virtual production content, created within Unreal Engine, can be incorporated into a higher education setting in the context of an undergraduate graphics module. Aspects of workflow, content style and interaction, as well as content production with inexperienced users will be investigated.

The reason this project is a good use of Unreal Engine is that we are specifically targeting content that is already dealing with the subject of real-time graphics. The plan is to actually be able to demonstrate real-time graphics content in the context of the engine whilst explaining the educational content. We already teach students graphics programming using Unreal Engine, the focus here is to learn how we can use new virtual production methods to produce more engaging forms of content that maintains or improves the quality of the learning. With the aim of spreading that information across to different subject areas.

### Does it support the community?
Part of the work package for this project will be video vlogs to detail the process of capture, hardware setups and other process learnings as it develops the VP content. In addition, we intend that any learning from this process will then be disseminated both across the University to be rolled out across more courses, but also made available to everyone via YouTube. The overall impact will be to encourage real-time graphics usage within the education sector as a primary toolset.

### How do you plan to grow? 
We envision that this project will eventually lead to investment from the University in the area of virtual production across all courses. We also see potential for student projects related to virtual production and plan on developing a programme related to virtual production in the near future. More broadly, we plan on disseminating the learnings from this project in academic journals and other research venues, as well as making content publically available on YouTube and streaming via Twitch. With other plans to develop enabling technology as a potential spinoff enterprise.

### What is the project budget and plan?
The plan is to take existing course content for a third year undergraduate graphics module on the Games Computing/Computer Science degrees at the University of Lincoln and create an entirely new set of content that incorporates virtual production techniques at its core. The planned work is as follows:

- Evaluate existing content and core principles that would be suitable for virtual production techniques
- Identify VP methodology for capturing content and ideate potential for new methods
- Establish content production workflows to capture new content
- Produce weekly vlogs during the duration of the project, showing the process, hardware and software details so that others can recreate a similar setup
- Capture the content for the module, develop production tools for the automated handling of the content pipeline
- Edit the final content
- Publish final content
- Evaluate the educational value of the changed content

The budget for this project is mainly intended for the purchase of hardware required to capture content as all other work will be covered by the University staff and students involved with the project. Main line items are as follows:

- Camera equipment ($20k) to include cameras (x3), capture devices, tripods, lenses etc.
- GreenScreen equipment ($1500)
- Tracking equipment ($5k)
- Motion capture equipment (8k) (depth sensors, inertia suit)
- Lens encoders ($1500)
- Wireless controllers/monitors ($5k)
- Recording hardware/switchers ($2500)
- Displays to enable playback for virtual content ($2500)
- Main project capture/editing PC ($4k)

Total: $50,000

The project will be housed in a lab space at the University of Lincoln.
